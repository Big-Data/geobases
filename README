All doc has been moved here for this package:
    http://mediawiki.orinet.nce.amadeus.net/index.php/GeoBases

To generate packages (this will produce rpm and tar.gz files):
    rm dist/*
    python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm

This package may be installed using:
    pip install --upgrade --user dist/GeoBase.whatever.tar.gz

If you install a package in user space, you may want to check
that your ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH, and that Python knows 
where you site-package is (check your $PYTHONPATH).
This line should be added to your ~/.zshrc anyway:
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
