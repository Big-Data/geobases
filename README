All doc has been moved here for this package:
    http://mediawiki.orinet.nce.amadeus.net/index.php/GeoBases

To run the tests:
    find ./ -name '*pyc' -exec rm {} \;
    python test/test_GeoBases.py -v

To install the package:
    git clone git@gitorious.orinet.nce.amadeus.net:dataanalysis/geobases.git
    cd geobases
    python setup.py install --user

You may try to remove the package with pip:
    pip uninstall GeoBases

If you install a package in user space, you may want to check
that your ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH, and that Python knows 
where you site-package is (check your $PYTHONPATH).
This line should be added to your ~/.zshrc anyway:
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin

Some precaution: if you are running debian/ubuntu, installation might
fail due to lack of compilation tool after fresh installation. If you have
an error like *Error: Python.h could not be found*, you can fix it with:
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
